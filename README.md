# COVID-19 Deaths Analysis in India

This repository contains an analysis of COVID-19 deaths in India, focusing on identifying patterns of most and least affected regions using key epidemiological metrics: **Crude Death Rate (CDR)** and **Death Ratio**.

## Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact globally, and India experienced significant challenges in managing the spread of the virus and its mortality. This project aims to provide a data-driven insight into the regional variations of COVID-19 fatalities across India. By calculating and comparing the Crude Death Rate and Death Ratio for different states/union territories, we highlight areas that experienced disproportionately high or low mortality.

## Analysis Focus

* **Crude Death Rate (CDR):** This metric provides a general overview of mortality by expressing the number of deaths per 100,000 population. It helps to understand the overall impact of COVID-19 on the population in various regions.
* **Death Ratio:** This metric, often interpreted as case fatality rate (CFR) in the context of infectious diseases, represents the proportion of confirmed cases that resulted in death. It sheds light on the severity of the disease and potentially the effectiveness of healthcare interventions in different regions.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on publicly available COVID-19 data for India, primarily sourced from:
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandhuh/latest-covid19-india-statewise-data

## Repository Structure

* `data/`: Contains the raw and processed datasets used for the analysis.
* `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks or scripts demonstrating the data cleaning, analysis, and visualization steps.
* `results/`: Stores generated plots, tables, and key findings.
* `README.md`: This file, providing a description of the project.

## Key Insights (Examples - will be filled after analysis)

* Identification of states/UTs with the highest and lowest Crude Death Rates.
* Regions exhibiting significant disparities between their CDR and Death Ratio, suggesting factors beyond just case numbers influencing mortality.
* Visualizations showcasing geographical patterns of COVID-19 deaths across India.

## How to Replicate

1.  Clone this repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
2.  Install the required libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to regenerate the analysis and visualizations.
